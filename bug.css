The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascade.  The unexpected behavior arises because the rule `h1 em` is more specific than `h1`, even though both target `<h1>` elements. This leads to the `color: blue` declaration overriding the `color: red` declaration, resulting in blue text instead of red. This situation is subtle and might be difficult to debug without understanding the intricacies of CSS specificity.
