The solution is to increase the specificity of the h1 selector to ensure it overrides the h1 em rule. Here are two ways to accomplish this:

**Method 1: Using an ID selector:**

```css
#my-heading {
  color: red;
}

#my-heading em {
  color: blue;
}
```

By adding an ID to the heading, we increase specificity. Now #my-heading will always override any rules for h1 em

**Method 2: Using a more specific class selector:**
```css
.important-heading {
  color: red;
}

.important-heading em {
  color: blue;
}
```

Adding a class makes the selector more specific, so it overrides the rule applied to only `em` elements inside `h1` tags.

Choose either method based on the structure and needs of your HTML.
